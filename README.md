# Synthetic-Gradients
My attempt to implement [Decoupled Neural Interfaces using Synthetic Gradients](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05343 "Deepmind's paper")  
  
The models are built using Tensorflow 1.0.0  
A working decoupled model using synthetic gradients tested on a fully-connected neural net trained on MNIST can be found in:  
[tensorflow/scripts_dev/experiments/exp06.py](tensorflow/scripts_dev/experiments/exp06.py)  
  
The original non-decoupled network trained on MNIST can be found in:  
[tensorflow/scripts_dev/working_mnist.ipynb](tensorflow/scripts_dev/working_mnist.ipynb)
