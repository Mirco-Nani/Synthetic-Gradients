# Synthetic-Gradients
My attempt to implement [Decoupled Neural Interfaces using Synthetic Gradients](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05343 "Deepmind's paper")  
  
The models are built using Tensorflow 1.0.0  
A working solution tested on MNIST can be found in [tensorflow/scripts_dev/experiments/exp06.py](tensorflow/scripts_dev/experiments/exp06.py)
